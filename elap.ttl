We use this framework to analyze three case studies in detail. The model is useful for understanding the relation between service offering and the challenges of coordinating public service networks. Overcoming these challenges results in better leveraging the advantages of business models. Our findings indicate business models that facilitate knowledge transfer and understanding of shared resources and network capabilities can further enhance better resource mix in migrating toward citizen-oriented business models"@en .

Digital sovereignty is key in ensuring the ability of citizens and public administrations to make decisions and act in a self-determined manner in the digital world. We must ensure that all underlying digital components of ICT solutions (hardware, software, and services) meet European requirements. We must create the right conditions for Europe to develop and deploy our own key digital capacities, including the deployment of secure cloud infrastructure and interoperable services that fully comply with European legal provisions and ethical values. Common standards, modular architectures and the use of Open-Source Software (OSS) in the public sector are facilitators for deploying and developing strategic digital tools and capacities. We must ensure the availability of diverse and high-performing digital solutions to guarantee freedom of choice and the ability to change IT modules when necessary. Software, data and tools generated by the public sector should be reusable and openly accessible as long as this is compliant with fundamental rights. As explained in the European data strategy, a strengthened interoperability framework, as well as suitable regulatory frameworks are key in helping Europe benefit from the economic value of data, thus creating a single market for data that will ensure Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty."""@en .

The choice of architecture, especially of on premise and/or public cloud, will depend on the advantages, constraints and risks for a specific system. So it does not mean that all systems should go to the public cloud."@en .
