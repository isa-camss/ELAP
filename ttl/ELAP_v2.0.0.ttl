At the technical level, mechanisms, tools and standards should be part of processes certification that data exchange involving all stakeholders, is saved, with integrity and trustable. """@en;

Everyone should be able to navigate the digital world safely, authenticate and be digitally recognised within the EU conveniently. All people of Europe should avail of an easy to use, widely accepted and secure electronic identification conforming to European standards (e-ID), which allows them to securely access public, private and cross-border digital services. As a broad acceptance of digital government depends on trust, we must ensure that citizens and businesses are able to rely on trustworthy and verifiable digital government applications and services, which are in full conformity with high-security standards and respond to user needs. Moreover, to ensure a free, open and safe digital domain and enhance social trust, fundamental rights and security should be integrated on all policies with a digital dimension. To foster trust in digital interactions with the public sector, suitable regulatory frameworks must be provided that ensure transparency, predictability, security-by-design and, where necessary, reinforcement or adjustment of existing provisions."""@en;

    """A multi-channel service delivery approach, meaning the availability of alternative channels, physical and digital, to access a service, is an important part of public service design, as users may prefer different channels depending on the circumstances.
A single point of contact should be made available to users, to hide internal administrative complexity and facilitate access to public services, e.g. when multiple bodies have to work together to provide a public service.
Users’ feedback should be systematically collected, assessed and used to design new public services and to improve existing ones further.
As far as possible, under the legislation in force, users should be able to provide data once only, and administrations should be able to retrieve and share this data to serve the user, in accordance with data protection rules.
Users should be asked to provide only the information that is absolutely necessary to obtain a given public service."""@en;
