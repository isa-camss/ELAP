This principle is pivotal for creating a fair digital public services ecosystem, where collaboration and participation are based on service excellence rather than resource control, ultimately benefiting consumers and promoting a healthy market. For example, public administrations at different levels (State, Regions, Local) should be able to collaborate and join efforts in new services without being limited by their varying levels of resources.

These APIs should follow established guidelines to ensure consistency, security, and ease of integration. Security and privacy measures must be robust, ensuring that data is protected across all nodes of the infrastructure. Additionally, continuous monitoring and governance frameworks are necessary to maintain compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and to ensure the trustworthiness of the system. Proper organisational agreements should be established to ensure the implementation of digital public services without hampering any changes or modifications. At the technical level, this can be achieved by reusing existing solutions or components that ensure interoperability between services without including dependencies between them. Furthermore, adopting microservices architecture can enhance loose coupling by allowing independent deployment and scaling of services. Implementing asynchronous communication methods, such as message queues or event-driven architectures, can further decouple components, improving system resilience and flexibility. Lastly, maintaining comprehensive documentation and versioning of APIs is crucial to support ongoing development and integration efforts."@en;

This principle ensures that public administrations make efficient use of resources by leveraging existing investments and avoiding unnecessary duplication. Additionally, reusing proven solutions can enhance the reliability and interoperability of public services, as these systems have already been tested and validated in real-world scenarios. By prioritising reuse, public administrations can focus on optimising and integrating existing solutions to meet their needs, fostering innovation and improving service delivery without incurring the high costs and risks associated with building new systems from scratch."@en,
    """Implementing the principle of \"Reuse, before buy, before build\" requires both business and technical considerations. Public bodies and administrations must conduct thorough assessments of existing systems, services, and solutions to determine their suitability for reuse. This involves evaluating the functionality, scalability, and interoperability of these systems to ensure they can meet current and future requirements. When existing solutions are not sufficient, the next step is to consider purchasing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions that can be customised to fit specific needs. Building new systems should only be considered as a last resort when no existing solutions can fulfil essential requirements.

From a technical perspective, public administrations must establish robust frameworks for evaluating and integrating existing systems. This includes adopting open standards and protocols to ensure interoperability, implementing secure data management practices, and maintaining comprehensive documentation to facilitate the reuse of systems. Additionally, public bodies should promote a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, encouraging the reuse of solutions across different departments and agencies.

Transparency in digital public services ensures that data is easily accessible, understandable, and usable, promoting better decision-making and enhancing public trust. By making information about how data is collected, processed, and used openly available, organisations can demonstrate their commitment to ethical practices and accountability.

Overall, transparency supports the creation of a more open, responsive, and trustworthy public sector, driving innovation and improving service delivery."@en,

Business processes should include clear guidelines for data transparency, ensuring that data and metadata are available through standardised mechanisms and maintained for long-term availability. Decision-making processes should be documented and made accessible to stakeholders, providing insights into the rationale and criteria used. Technically, solutions must support real-time data access, user-friendly interfaces, and robust security measures to protect sensitive information while ensuring transparency. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to maintain transparency and address any emerging issues.

    "Implementing the principle of using standards in the design and implementation of solutions is crucial for ensuring consistency, reliability, and interoperability across digital public services. Standards provide clear benchmarks and guidelines that help streamline development processes, reduce complexity, and enhance the quality of services. By adhering to established standards, organisations can ensure that their solutions are interoperable with other systems or services, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration. This approach also promotes transparency and accountability, as standards are often developed through consensus and reflect best practices. The Interoperable Europe Act underscores the importance of using harmonised standards to support the development of interoperable public services, contributing to government efficiency and reducing administrative burdens and costs for citizens and businesses. Compliance with these standards, while generally voluntary, provides a presumption of conformity with essential requirements, enhancing trust and reliability. Ultimately, the use of standards supports the creation of robust, scalable, and user-friendly public services that meet the needs of citizens and businesses."@en,
    "To effectively implement the Use of standards, organisations must adopt and adhere to relevant standards and specifications throughout the design and development process. Business processes should include rigorous conformance assessments and validation steps to ensure compliance with selected standards. Technically, solutions must be designed to support interoperability and compatibility with established standards, including the use of specific protocols, formats, and interfaces. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to maintain compliance and address any emerging issues. The use of mechanisms and methods for analysing and assessing specifications against specific constraints or frameworks are valuable tools to ensure interoperable digital public services. The Common Assessment Method for Standards and Specifications (CAMSS) is an example of an action and set of solutions that can be used to carefully select and evaluate the candidate specifications.  Additionally, fostering a culture of adherence to standards and best practices is essential to ensure that all stakeholders understand and commit to the principle. Training and capacity-building initiatives should be implemented to equip staff with the knowledge and skills needed to apply standards effectively."@en;
